= Getting Started

*OpenZeppelin is a library for secure smart contract development.* It provides implementations of standards like ERC20 and ERC721 which you can deploy as-is or extend to suit your needs, as well as Solidity components to build custom contracts and more complex decentralized systems.

[[install]]
== Install

OpenZeppelin should be installed directly into your existing node.js project with `npm install openzeppelin-solidity`. We will use https://truffleframework.com/truffle[Truffle], an Ethereum development environment, to get started.

Please install Truffle and initialize your project:

[source,sh]
----
$ mkdir myproject
$ cd myproject
$ npm init -y
$ npm install truffle
$ npx truffle init
----

To install the OpenZeppelin library, run the following in your Solidity project root directory:

[source,sh]
----
$ npm install openzeppelin-solidity
----

NOTE: OpenZeppelin features a stable API, which means your contracts won't break unexpectedly when upgrading to a newer minor version. You can read ṫhe details in our xref:api-stability.adoc[API Stability] document.

[[usage]]
== Usage

Once installed, you can start using the contracts in the library by importing them:

[source,solidity]
----
pragma solidity ^0.5.0;

import 'openzeppelin-solidity/contracts/ownership/Ownable.sol';

contract MyContract is Ownable {
  ...
}
----

Truffle and other Ethereum development toolkits will automatically detect the installed library, and compile the imported contracts.

IMPORTANT: You should always use the installed code as-is, and neither copy-paste it from online sources, nor modify it yourself.

OpenZeppelin's xref:api:token/ERC20.adoc[full API] is also thoroughly documented, and serves as a great reference when developing your smart contract application.

Additionally, you can also ask for help or follow OpenZeppelin's development in the https://forum.openzeppelin.com[community forum].

Finally, you may want to take a look at the guides on our blog, which cover several common use cases and good practices: https://blog.openzeppelin.com/guides. The following articles provide great background reading, though please note, some of the referenced tools have changed as the tooling in the ecosystem continues to rapidly evolve.
