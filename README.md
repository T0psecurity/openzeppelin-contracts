# Zeppelin Solidity
Zeppelin is a library for writing secure Smart Contracts on Ethereum.

With Zeppelin, you can build distributed applications, protocols and organizations:
- using common contract security patterns (See [Onward with Ethereum Smart Contract Security](https://medium.com/bitcorps-blog/onward-with-ethereum-smart-contract-security-97a827e47702#.y3kvdetbz))
- in the Solidity language.

## Getting Started

Zeppelin integrates with [Truffle](https://github.com/ConsenSys/truffle), an Ethereum development environment. Please [install Truffle](https://github.com/ConsenSys/truffle#install) and initialize your project with `truffle init`.
```sh
sudo npm install -g truffle
mkdir myproject && cd myproject
truffle init
```

To install the Zeppelin library, run:
```sh
npm i zeppelin-solidity
```

After that, you'll get all the library's contracts in the `contracts/zeppelin` folder. You can use the contracts in the library like so:

```js
import "./zeppelin/Rejector.sol";

contract MetaCoin is Rejector { 
  ...
}
```

> NOTE: The current distribution channel is npm, which is not ideal. [We're looking into providing a better tool for code distribution](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/zep-solidity/issues/13), and ideas are welcome.

#### Truffle Beta Support
We also support Truffle Beta npm integration. If you're using Truffle Beta, the contracts in `node_modules` will be enough, so feel free to delete the copies at your `contracts` folder. If you're using Truffle Beta, you can use Zeppelin contracts like so:

```js
import "zeppelin-solidity/contracts/Rejector.sol";

contract MetaCoin is Rejector { 
  ...
}
```

## Security
Zeppelin is meant to provide secure, tested and community-audited code, but please use common sense when doing anything that deals with real money! We take no responsibility for your implementation decisions.

If you find a security issue, please email [security@openzeppelin.org](mailto:security@openzeppelin.org).
